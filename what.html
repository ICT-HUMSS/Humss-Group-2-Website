<h1>What do we do in Humss?</h1>

<p>Students in HUMSS do a lot of things that involve studying and exploring the human condition and society. 
We learn about various disciplines and ideas in the social sciences, such as philosophy, religion, politics, sociology, anthropology, and more. 
We also develop their creativity and critical thinking skills through subjects like literature, creative writing, and research. 
</p>

<p>Here are some of the activities that we do in humss:</p>

<h2>Writing essays, stories, poems, or articles on topics that interest us or relate to current issues.</h2>
<p>HUMSS students should be updated on current events by watching the news briefly every day or reading through news articles from reputable news agencies so they can properly give their opinions on certain topics.</p>

<h2>Participating in discussions and debates on moral, ethical, or social issues.</h2>
<p>HUMSS students can also participate in extracurricular activities such as debate, writing, and public speaking to further enhance their skills and showcase their talents.</p>

<h2>Engaging in community service or advocacy projects that aim to address social problems or promote positive change.</h2>
<p>HUMSS students can also participate or create their own program in their own advocacy, which we do in the subject of Community Engagement, Solidarity, and Citizenship.</p>

<h2>We conduct research projects on topics that interest them or are relevant to their future careers.</h2>
<p>We use online sources, libraries, museums, or other resources to gather information and present their findings in written or oral forms.
We're also tasked to gather data using surveys and other methods.</p>


<p>These are just some of the examples of what students do in HUMSS.
There are many more activities that students can engage in such as reading literature from different cultures and periods, exploring world religions and belief systems, participating in community service projects, or creating artworks that express their ideas and feelings.
HUMSS students are not only learners but also creators who can use their knowledge and skills to make positive contributions to society.
