<h1>Experiences</h1>

<h2>Buenafrancisca</h2>
<p>As a Humanities student its required to have basic knowledge on the courses and the subjects that it will be covering. My time as a humms student was both stressful and fulfilling. 
I believe it will help me grow as an individual and a member of the community.</p>

<h2>Buere</h2>
<p>As a student of Humanities and Social Sciences, I've discovered many capabilities within myself that I never thought I could do. 
I've widened my knowledge not only about society but also about its various aspects. Being a HUMSS student has greatly helped me develop and enrich the abilities I possess.
</p>

<h2>Calimlim</h2>
<p>Being a Humss student has been quite a challenge but it was a thrilling experience because I got to do and enjoy the things that I'm fond of; reading and writing poems, stories, essays, getting to know different perspectives.
I got the chance to meet different people with amazing views about certain topics. 
I became aware of the importance of using my voice and I get to be updated on current events in our country. </p>

<h2>Cervantes</h2>
<p>As a HUMSS student, I can tell you about a variety of experiences I've had, such as the recent event that was thrilling, leisurely, and enjoyable.
I learned social skills from everyone I met at the university as a HUMSS student. Considering how many friends I made that I will always treasure, I believe that this was also one of my best school years.</p>

<h2>Clarete</h2>
<p>Being in the HUMSS strand has taught me a lot, it’s an unwavering journey, an enriching voyage that equips one to be able to comprehend, critique, and appreciate the complexities of human experience.</p>

<h2>Dalumay</h2>
<p>As a student from HUMMS, I can say that the program really did a great job in putting the curriculums together. 
Despite the diverse learning experiences, I still manage to feel the sense of belonging even if I am just an average student. 
That is why, having an introverted and extroverted personality doesn't really make a big deal in meeting and engaging with different groups of people. 
All in all, it was a worthwhile experience with the people whom I considered as strangers became my comrade, partners, and friends.</p>

<h2>Deabanico</h2>
<p>As a HUMSS student, I sometimes feel that we are being underestimated because of the toxic mindset that HUMSS is an easy strand.
People often say “ah HUMSS lang” when they ask what strand am I in, I find it sad and kind of offensive.</p>
