<p>The acronym HUMSS stands for (HU) Humanities and (S) Social (S) Sciences. 
It is a strand for students who will take a K-12 program or Grade 11 to Grade 12 year level. 
In academic strand you will expect a lot of reading and writing activities all the time. 
Humanities and Social Sciences is mainly about being socially and politically aware of your surroundings and developing you to public speaking. 
Most of the time, students pick HUMSS to avoid the Math subject. 
But on most occasions, students choose this strand for them to nurture and engage more into being creative, critical, and socially involved with other people in the society.</p>
